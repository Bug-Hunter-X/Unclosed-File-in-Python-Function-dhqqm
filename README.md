This repository showcases a common Python bug: forgetting to close files after opening them.  The 'bug.py' file demonstrates the problematic code; 'bugSolution.py' provides a corrected version using the 'with' statement for automatic file closure.  Failure to properly close files can lead to resource exhaustion and data corruption. Always ensure proper file handling to avoid these issues.
